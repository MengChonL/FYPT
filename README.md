# Designing_a_Gamified_Training_Platform_for_Recognizing_Web3_Phishing_Attacks

# Supervisor
Prof. Ye Wang

# Introduction

With the rapid growth of blockchain technologies and decentralized applications (dApps), Web3 is creating new opportunities for asset management and online interaction, but it also introduces significant usability barriers and security risks. Among these, phishing attacks are one of the most harmful: users may be tricked into connecting their wallets or approving malicious transactions, often resulting in irreversible financial losses.

# Potential Methods

This project proposes the design of a gamified training platform to help users practice recognizing Web3 phishing attempts. The platform will simulate realistic scenarios such as wallet connections and token approvals. Both safe and malicious cases will be embedded, including fake domains, fraudulent airdrops, and excessive token authorizations. Users will receive instant feedback on their choices, experience the consequences of mistakes in a safe environment, and improve their recognition skills through repeated practice. After the initial design, a user study will be conducted and the platform will be iteratively refined based on feedback from participants.

# Requirements

Students with prior experience in design or development are preferred. Strong motivation, ability to work independently, and interest in human computer interaction are expected.
